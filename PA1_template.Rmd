Load the Data:
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day
###Calculate total number of steps taken per day (here you can see the first 6 rows of the table dataframe created)

```{r total, echo=TRUE}
activity1 <- activity[ with (activity, { !(is.na(steps)) } ), ]
table_sum <- aggregate(activity1["steps"], by=activity1["date"], sum)
head(table_sum)
```
###Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r total2, echo=TRUE}
hist(table_sum$steps, main="Histogram of total number of steps per day", 
     xlab="Total number of steps in a day")
```

###Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r total3, echo=TRUE}
neat_table <- matrix(c(mean(table_sum$steps),median(table_sum$steps)))
rownames(neat_table) <- c("Mean","Median")
colnames(neat_table) <- "Steps"
as.table(neat_table)
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?

###Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r plot, echo=TRUE}
#to left side ~: what is being aggregated and to right side: what is being used to aggregate
library(ggplot2)
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity1, mean)
ggplot(steps_by_interval,aes(x=interval,y=steps)) +
  ggtitle("Average number of steps across all days") +
  xlab("5-minute Interval") + ylab("Average number of steps") +
  geom_line() 
```
###Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r answer, echo=TRUE}
# find row with max of steps
max_steps_row <- which.max(steps_by_interval$steps)

# interval corresponding to max number of steps:
answer <- steps_by_interval[max_steps_row, ]$interval
```
The 5-min interval which contains the maximum number of steps is `r answer`

Total number missing values
```{r missing, echo=TRUE}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```


## 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
Decided to use the mean for the steps of that day: get the day in aggregate and pull out mean

```{r modif, echo=TRUE}
activity_mod <- activity

# Loop through all the rows of activity, find the one with NA for steps.
# For each identify the interval for that row
# Then identify the avg steps for that interval in avg_steps_per_interval
# Substitute the NA value with that value

for (i in 1:nrow(activity_mod)) {
  if(is.na(activity_mod$steps[i])) {
    val <- steps_by_interval$steps[which(steps_by_interval$interval == activity$interval[i])]
    activity_mod$steps[i] <- val 
  }
}

# Aggregate the steps per day with the imputed values
steps_per_day_impute <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_mod, sum)

hist(steps_per_day_impute$steps, main="Histogram of total number of steps per day (NA filled in)", 
     xlab="Total number of steps in a day")
```

### Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
### Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
### What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
```{r neat_table2}
neat_table2 <- matrix(c(mean(steps_per_day_impute$steps),median(steps_per_day_impute$steps)))
rownames(neat_table2) <- c("Mean","Median")
colnames(neat_table2) <- "Steps"
as.table(neat_table2)
```
Mean has not changed, Median increased slightly. 

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
### 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r weekday, echo=TRUE}
#function check if day is weekday
#convert to date bc weekdays() works with POSIXt or Date.

week_day <- function(date_val) {
  wd <- weekdays(as.Date(date_val, '%Y-%m-%d'))
  if  (!(wd == 'Saturday' || wd == 'Sunday')) {
    x <- 'Weekday'
  } else {
    x <- 'Weekend'
  }
  x
}


# Apply the week_day function and add a new column called day_type to activity dataset
activity_mod$day_type <- as.factor(sapply(activity_mod$date, week_day))

#load the ggplot library
library(ggplot2)

# Create the aggregated data frame by intervals and day_type
steps_per_day_impute <- aggregate(steps ~ interval+day_type, activity_mod, mean)

# Create the plot
ggplot(steps_per_day_impute, aes(interval, steps)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = day_type)) +
  facet_grid(day_type ~ .) +
  labs(x="Interval", y=expression("No of Steps")) +
  ggtitle("No of steps Per Interval by day type")
```
